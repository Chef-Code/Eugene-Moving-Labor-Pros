#Eugene Moving Labor Pros

Hello Again Eugene, Oregon and all Surrounding Areas. Eugene Moving Labor Pros are Professional Movers with all the know how you expect from a moving company. Our Company Service qualifies as the Following: Pack and loaders provide a specialized labor service for those who want to rent a truck and move themselves but not do all the packing and heavy lifting. Oregon HB 2817 specifies that pack and loaders are exempt from motor carrier regulations if:

They do not provide or operate a vehicle for moving household goods.
Act as an agent for someone who does provide or operate the vehicle.
Note: Watch out for businesses that publicly advertise a service to pack and load household goods, then offer to provide a truck when you call. Oregon law allows a person to offer pack and load services, but it doesnÂ´t allow that person to provide the vehicle used in the move.
The preceding was straight from the Oregon Department of Transportation or ODOT.
